## Downloading Node:
This package will install:
•	Node.js v16.14.2 to /usr/local/bin/node
•	npm v8.5.0 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.

## Moving composer to your path, this runs it globally with just `composer` as the command
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

## To download the selenium web driver 
composer require php-webdriver/webdriver
